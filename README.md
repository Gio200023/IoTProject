This is the repository for the Embedded Software for IoT course's project. 
It is a remote controller for a RC car, specifically it consists of a trasmitter placed on a glove that measures the motion of the hand. Then it is transmitted to the on-board receiver that it controls directly the car through two servo motors.
It is used two MPS-EXP432P401R boards both as transmitter and receiver equipped with an nRF24L01+ module.
On the trasmitter side it is attached a MKII Boosterpack, which is only used for the accelerometer.
